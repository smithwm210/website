Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts with a passion for game design. So far, I have finished 7 games, 4 of which were in collaboration with other WPI students. I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Interactive Media and Game Development in May 2025. I'm interested in all aspects of game development, with a primary focus on game programming and design.
