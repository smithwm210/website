              winning game of IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, which had the theme Don't Stop! (~30 participants).
              My main takeaway from this game was how to be flexible and to adapt within tight deadlines.
              We were given some fun restrictions like all sound effects originating from our voices, a prominent MS Paint animation, and more! <br>

              A character-focused narrative fantasy RPG made in two weeks. I honed my leadership skills as we undertook this large project.
              We each wrote a character quest, and I learned to give up control, trust my teammates, and bring the quests together into a cohesive narrative. <br>

              My first solo project! A deceptively simple puzzle game that you can't put down.
              I'm super proud of the mechanics I was able to implement in a short period of time. <br>

              I have been managing a gaming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unlimitedwill">YouTube channel</a> for over 6 years.
              I showcase some of the most difficult and astounding levels made in the Super Mario Maker 2 community, and have amassed over 1500 followers.
              On average, I upload a new video twice a week and the aspect of this project I'm most proud of is that I've never gone a week without uploading a new video.<br>
              I also frequently livestream myself playing on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unlimitedwill">Twitch</a>. <br>
              <br>
              Another one of my passions in gaming is speedrunning. I love delving deeply into the mechanics of a game and finding obscure oversights the devs missed.
              I have been involved in speedrunning in Super Mario Maker 2, Super Mario Bros, and Mario Wonder,
              and I was even invited to PACE Summer 2023, a charity event where I played RubberRoss's Mario Maker levels at a break-neck pace.<br>
              RubberRoss is a well-known YouTuber and streamer notorious for making very hard Mario stages, and he was floored by my ability to circumvent his challenges, as seen below. <br>

              Offline, I've enjoyed collaborating on several other projects.
              I led a <a href="https://digital.wpi.edu/show/pz50h184z">project</a> working with the US Forest Service to develop lesson plans for students in New Hampshire.
              I've always loved being part of a team, devoting several years to football, lacrosse, and basketball teams.

            <p>
              Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts with a passion for game design.
              So far, I have finished five games, three of which were in collaboration with other WPI students. I'm pursuing a Technology BS in Interactive Media and Game Development.
              I'm interested in all aspects of game development, with a primary focus on game programming and design.
