              This 2D Platformer and zombie shooter was my foray into game design with Unity and Github! <br>
              It introduced me to the game development process as we got used to basic dev tools in about one month. <br>

              The fast-paced sidescroller where you platform as a glass sliding along the bar. <br>
              Slid Not Stirred was the winning game of IGDA WPI's Cutthroat Game Jam, which had the theme Don't Stop! (~30 participants) <br>
              My main takeaway from this game was how to be flexible and to adapt within tight deadlines. <br>
              We were given some fun restrictions like all sound effects originating from our voices, having to include a prominent MS Paint animation, and more! <br>

              A character-focused narrative fantasy RPG made in two weeks. <br>
              I honed my leadership skills as we undertook this large project.
              We each wrote a character quest, and I learned to trust my teammates as we brought the quests together into a cohesive narrative. You can watch a full, voice-acted playthrough <a href="https://youtu.be/q0hGgMNs_tk">here</a>.<br>

              <i> White to Grey - Grey to Black - Black to White</i> <br>
              This simple yet head-scratching puzzle game is my first solo project!
              I'm super proud of the mechanics I was able to implement in a short period of time. <br>
              This game taught me about the iterative approach to level design and
              challenged me to improve player readability without using words or tutorials. <br>

              An arcade-style game that captures the manic feeling of Tetris in bite-size form. <br>
              This was my next solo project after Cross-Stitch.
              I wanted to make a game that was small in scope, but nicely polished and complete, while also dipping my toes into 2D pixelart. <br>

              A cozy, cooperative, hand-drawn puzzle game. <br>
              I built up my puzzle design skills, creating ten levels that smoothly introduce several unique mechanics.
              This was my first time making a multiplayer game, and it was very enriching to design for and playtest 
              with pairs of players, rather than just one. <br>

              <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
              <p>
                I was the Project Manager of a Software Engineering team of 11 students
                tasked with creating a hospital website from scratch. <br> <br>
                For much of the team, it was our first experience with Typescript and React, but we were able to
                implement many features like multi-floor pathfinding, employee and service request management,
                database hosting through AWS, an AI assistant, and an animated 3D map within 6 weeks. <br> <br>
                We managed the project with Jira and Agile methodologies.

              <p>
                I led a <a href="https://digital.wpi.edu/show/pz50h184z">community project</a>
                working with the US Forest Service to develop lesson plans for students in New Hampshire. <br> <br>
                Myself and 3 other WPI students stayed in Lincoln, New Hampshire for about 2 months working with
                Brendan Leonardi, Program Manager and Field Technician at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. <br> <br>
                We conducted background research, a focus group with Hubbard Brook staff, 7 interviews with local science educators,
                systematic observations of tours of the forest, created 4 lesson plans,
                and piloted 3 of them with local middle school students.

              <p>
                I have been managing a gaming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@unlimitedwill">YouTube channel</a> for over 7 years.
                I showcase some of the most difficult and astounding levels made in the Super Mario Maker 2 community, and have amassed over 3400 subscribers. <br> <br>
                On average, I upload a new video twice a week and the aspect of this project I'm most proud of is that
                I've never gone a week without uploading a new video. <br> <br>
                As a result of this, I have become well-versed in software like Davinci Resolve, Adobe Photoshop, and OBS. <br>
                I also frequently livestream myself playing on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unlimitedwill">Twitch</a>.

              <h2>Speedrunning</h2>
              <p>
                One of my passions in gaming is speedrunning. I love delving deeply into the mechanics of a game and finding obscure oversights the devs missed. <br> <br>
                I have been involved in speedrunning in Super Mario Maker 2, Super Mario Bros, and Mario Wonder,
                and I was even invited to PACE Summer 2023, a charity event where I played RubberRoss's Mario Maker levels at a world record pace.<br> <br>
                RubberRoss is a well-known YouTuber and streamer notorious for making very hard Mario stages, and he was floored by my ability to circumvent his challenges, as seen below. <br>

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
              I am pursuing a BS in Interactive Media and Game Development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. <br>
              I'm in the class of 2025, with a cumulative GPA of 3.87. <br> <br>
              I am incredibly grateful for the opportunities opened up to me through WPI, including both the
              <a href="#Soft-Eng">Software Engineering project</a>, and the <a href="#New-Hampshire">Lesson Design Project</a> in New Hampshire. <br>
              More than just knowledge of computer science, WPI has taught me time management and communication skills. <br> <br>
              Most schools have 2 semesters with students taking 5 or 6 classes each, but WPI has quarters.
              So I only have 3 courses at a time, but they are completed twice as fast.
              This leads to a very fast-paced schedule, but I have been able to adapt and thrive in this environment. <br>
              Additionally, I started my college experience during COVID, and now I am completely comfortable working remotely, in-person, or hybrid.  <br> <br>
              WPI prides itself on its emphasis of project-based learning, which I believe prepares me for a job
              in game development much better than lecture-based learning.

              I currently am the video editor for Stone Coast Community Church in Rhode Island. <br>
              Since March 2024, I have been editing and uploading the weekly services to the church's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@stonecoast">YouTube channel</a>,
              as well as creating 1-minute shorts from each recording. <br> <br>
              I have been attending and volunteering on the tech team at this church since 2016.
              Below is an image of some editing work I did for a Mother's Day video with the church's Youth Group.

              An AI project that uses a genetic algorithm to train a model to play the classic arcade game, Joust. <br>
              Named in reference to AlphaZero and AlphaGo, the models that mastered chess and Go, we wanted to create an AI that learned how to play a simpler game. <br>
              We used Unity to run a recreation of Joust, and NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies, or NEAT to set up the genetic algorithm. <br>

                  Hello! My name is Will and I am a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts with a passion for game design.
                  So far, I have finished 7 games, 4 of which were in collaboration with other WPI students.
                  I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in Interactive Media and Game Development in May 2025.
                  I'm interested in all aspects of game development, with a primary focus on game programming and design.
